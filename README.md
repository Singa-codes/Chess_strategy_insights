It looks like in the notebook you arrive the conclusion "A King's Pawn Game is about 50% more likely for a King's Gambit player than it is for a Sicilian mean player. Another difference is that the English Defense is much less popular with the latter." The first affirmation is the reverse of the opening question. In other words, I read it as King's gambit players like to play e4e5 when playing black. The second affirmation says Sicilian defense player doesn't like playing English Defense. So neither seem to be asserting if a Sicilian player like to play King's gambit. Both affirmations make sense though because I think that in general a player might want to keep his repertoire manageable (roughly the same tree when playing black or white).
